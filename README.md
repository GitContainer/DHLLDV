DHLLDV
======

Python implementation of the DHLLDV slurry transport framework

Note that the equations are from the as-yet unpublished book. Details available at http://www.dredgingengineering.com/dhlldv/.

The plan is to have a test suite for each python module. Tests are based on RCRs hand-calculations.
